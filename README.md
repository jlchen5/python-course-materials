# Basic programming for drug discovery - Python


## How to set up the Python for this course:
1. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Create a new environment using `conda_env_BPiDD_2019.yml`:
    * Option 1: [Use anaconda navigator to import the environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/#importing-an-environment) **untested**
    * Option 2: Create the environment with the command line: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Online using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). This takes around 10 minutes to get ready, but does not require any kind of setup on your end. Click here to get started: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)]
